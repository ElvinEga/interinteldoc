# Interintel

## Getting Started

This document contains the interview project for interintel technologies.

### Objectives

1. This are the tasks required to be accomplished by the project

Sort the below dictionary/array key using Javascript and

output the information in key:value format on a Polymer

interface. The entire numeric key should be sorted in an

ascending order and all the alpha keys should be sorted in

ascii, ascending order.

```py
Dictionary = {‘34’: ’thirty-four’, ‘90’: ‘ninety’,
‘91’: ‘ninety-one’‘21’: ‘twenty-one’,
‘61’: ‘sixty-one’, ‘9’: ‘nine’,
‘2’: ‘two’, ‘6’: ‘six’, ‘3’: ‘three’,
‘8’: ‘eight’, ‘80’: ‘eighty’, ‘81’: ‘eighty-one’,
‘Ninety-Nine’: ’99’, ‘nine-hundred’: ‘900’,}
```

_NB: The code snippet should be deployed using one of the two_

options below:

a. A HTML5 cross-platform mobile application using

Cordova. Use of standalone deployments like Node.js

or Chrome execution deployments is accepted.

b. A Django application on apache/nginx webserver and

NOT the development server. This should also be

deployed on a red-hat based Linux environment,

preferably \(CentOS\)

  2.Give examples of different integration protocols you have

come across and give example scripts in either python or

polymer on how to achieve each one.

 3.Give examples of different encryption/hashing methods

you have come across \(one way and two way\) and give

example scripts in either python or polymer on how to

achieve each one.
